# Night-and-Day
A clock that displays a sun or moon depending on the hour.  There are additional effects applied in the early morning and in the late evening.

This version is currently working without requiring Bootstrap, however, HTML scaffolding is in place for later versions, or if I change my mind.

##### Goals for v2.0 include:
<ul>
  <li>Sun/moon transitions across the sky as time passes</li>
  <li>Animated star background during night</li>
  <li>Responsive text size</li>
  <li>On click event for the sun/moon</li>
</ul>

##### Future aims:
<ul>
  <li>API calls for sunrise and sunset times, based on user location </li>
</ul>
